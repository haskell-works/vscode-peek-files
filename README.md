## ‚ú® Features

- Underlines filenames like `config.json`, `README.md`, `notes.txt` only if they exist in your project.
- Peek the **closest matching file** using:
  - `Cmd+Alt+P` (macOS) / `Ctrl+Alt+P` (Windows/Linux)
  - Or by `Alt+Cmd+Click` (like a definition peek)
- Smart file resolution:
  - Chooses the closest file path based on folder depth
  - Penalizes upward traversal using a configurable `parentTraversalCost`

## üñ±Ô∏è How It Works

If your code or text contains a string like:

```text
../data/schema.json
```

And a file named `schema.json` exists anywhere in your workspace, the word will be underlined. You can then:

- Press `Cmd+Alt+P` or `Alt+Cmd+Click` to **peek** that file.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Settings

You can customize behavior via VS Code settings:

| Setting                        | Type    | Default                     | Description                                                                 |
|-------------------------------|---------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `peekFiles.parentTraversalCost` | number  | `1000`                      | Cost of going up a directory when ranking file matches                     |
| `peekFiles.fileExtensions`    | string[] | `["json", "md", "txt", "yaml", "yml"]` | List of file extensions to underline and peek                              |

Example `settings.json`:
```json
{
  "peekFiles.parentTraversalCost": 500,
  "peekFiles.fileExtensions": ["json", "ts", "tsx", "md"]
}
```

## üß† Why?

VS Code already lets you peek symbols and definitions, but it doesn‚Äôt support peeking random filenames ‚Äî especially when written as plain text or code comments. This extension helps bridge that gap.

---

## üß™ Known Limitations

- Only matches by **basename** (not relative paths)
- Ignores `node_modules/**` for performance
- Currently only peeks to the **first line** of the file
